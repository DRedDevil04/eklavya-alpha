This limits the ability to gather system information, which is critical for assessing vulnerabilities.\n\n**Relevance to Penetration Testing:**\n- Establishing an SSH session is crucial for further testing and gathering system details. The next steps should focus on finding alternative methods to gain access or troubleshoot the SSH connection issue.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Investigate the SSH service status on the target.\n- Explore other methods for gaining access to the system (e.g., exploiting known vulnerabilities, using other protocols).\n- Monitor for any potential misconfigurations that could allow a session to be established."
